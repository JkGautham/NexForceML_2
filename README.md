# Cosmic Object Identification

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify cosmic objects from astronomical images. The goal is to identify planets, stars, and asteroids accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset contains images of various cosmic objects, including planets like Saturn, Mars, Uranus, Venus, Jupiter, Earth, Neptune, and Mercury.

## Results
The trained model achieves 0.888889 accuracy in classifying cosmic objects.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Explore larger datasets for improved performance.
- Develop user-friendly applications for easier cosmic object identification.
